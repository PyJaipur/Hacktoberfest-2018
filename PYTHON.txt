Python is a programming language, as are C, Fortran, BASIC, PHP, etc. Some specific features of Python
 are as follows:

1 An interpreted (as opposed to compiled) language. Contrary to e.g. C or Fortran, one does not compile
 Python code before executing it. In addition, Python can be used interactively: many Python 
interpreters are available, from which commands and scripts can be executed.
2. A free software released under an open-source license: Python can be used and distributed free of
 charge, even for building commercial software.
3. Multi-platform: Python is available for all major operating systems, Windows, Linux/Unix, MacOS X,
 most likely your mobile phone OS, etc.
4.A very readable language with clear non-verbose syntax
5.A language for which a large variety of high-quality packages are available for various applications,
 from web frameworks to scientific computing.
6.A language very easy to interface with other languages, in particular C and C++.
